Difference :

1) LinkedList element insertion is faster compared to ArrayList.

2) LinkedList element deletion is faster compared to ArrayList.

3) ArrayList search operation is pretty fast compared to the LinkedList Search Operation.
    LinkedList doesn't provide random or index based access and we need to iterate over linked list to
    retrieve any element.

4) LinkedList has more memory overhead than ArrayList because in ArrayList each index only holds actual
   object but in case of linkedlist each nodes holds both data and address of next and previous node (Dubly linkedlist).
